# Token Vesting-Ethereum

"Build my own XYZ TokenðŸª™, deployed an ERC-20 contract ðŸš€, Token Vesting contract, and also deployed a web-app to interact."

## About The Project

A decentralized application to interact with the XYZ TokenðŸª™, an 18 decimal token with a total supply of 100 million. The DApp is back-boned by Ethereum Smart Contracts.

Admin/token deployer can enter up to ten addresses (Beneficiary) where the token will disperse evenly for a mentioned period of duration. The token release schedule will be per minute.
A beneficiary can release only the amount of token vested and releasable.

Release transfers vested and releasable token to the beneficiary who calls it.

Deployed to **Rinkeby** test network.
